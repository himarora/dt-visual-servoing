V remove (?) timeout, what should happen before publishing anything
* slow refresh rate on cam
* catkin should not build every time
* simulator should handle log level param
* sample pose should work
V Make everything same level
V Make only 1 solution.py
* Map, init_pose and stuff in .env ?
V set log level in .env
  * make sure we see vnc and jupyter urls
V rm "dont forget to start launch_car_interface.."
* Ros core should also be able to switch log level
* we should output a "READY"
* Add comments
* what is the use of mounting ./utils ?
* We should improve the UX for dts challenges submit / eval
  -> We should not need local launch file
* We should clean the repo for better UX, more stuff into ./setup
  * fifos_connector in another repo might be a good idea
