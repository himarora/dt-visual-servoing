    "Motion planning is the task to find a feasible and collision-free path from a given pose to a goal pose. Ideally, a plan should respect the robotâ€™s kinematics and dynamics constraints. Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) is a single-query, sampling-based motion planning algorithm that works by building a tree graph, where the nodes represent states, and the edges represent what states are reachable from the others. RRT assumes that the map of the environment and the kinematics/dynamics of the robot are known. It also assumes that we have the ability to check for collision, as well as the ability to compute distance between two states. The algorithm is shown below.\n",

    "Given a goal state $x_{goal}$ and an initial state $x_{init}$, we first start with a graph with only $x_init$ as the only node. We then sample a random state $x_{rand}$, and find a node from the existing graph that is nearest to $x_{rand}$; we denote this nearest state as $x_{nearest}$. We then attempt to steer from $x_{nearest}$ towards $x_{rand}$ and get a new point $x_{new}$ that is between these two states (we will see how later in the example). Ideally, the steer function must adhere to the kinematics/dynamics of the robot. We then check if there are obstacles between $x_{nearest}$ and $x_{new}$. If there are no obstacles, we proceed to grow the graph by connecting $x_{nearest}$ and $x_{new}$. We then repeat this processes for $n$ steps, or until we find a path from $x_{init}$ to $x_{goal}$. Once done, we can obtain the path by going backwards from $x_{goal}$ to $x_{init}$. \n",
