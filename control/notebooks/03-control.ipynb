    "A controller outputs actions or control signals that can be executed by our robot to achieve a certain goal. For example, in the case of a mobile robot, the control signals can be the linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\\omega$ of the robot. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is an example of a feedback controller where we use the output of a system to measure errors or deviations from some target or reference point to alter the control signals so that the errors are minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Duckiebot driving in the middle of a road with a constant linear velocity. Let's say our goal is to make sure the robot stays in the middle of the lane by adjusting its angular velocity. Intuitively, whenever the robot deviates from the middle of the lane, we will adjust the angular velocity so the robot turns toward the middle of the lane. The question is: by how much?\n",
    "\n",
    "The name proportional-integral-derivative comes from the fact that the controller adjusts the control signals proportionally to the error at a particular time step $e(t)$, while also considers the integral of the error over time (i.e., the accumulation of error over time), and the derivative of the error at each time step (i.e., how the error changes over time). The control command $u(t)$ is calculated by considering the combination of these three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(t) = K_p \\cdot e(t) + K_i \\cdot \\int_0^t e(t) \\partial t + K_d \\cdot \\frac{\\partial e(t)}{\\partial t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ denote the proportional, integral, and derivative parameters, respectively. Our job is then to adjust these parameters (e.g., via trial and error) until the performance of our controller performs reasonably well. Generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing $K_p$ will decrease the the time it takes for the system to approach the reference point (i.e., rise time), but at the risk of overshooting. \n",
    "- Increasing $K_d$ will help to decrease this overshooting by resisting the robot from moving too quickly to reduce the error. \n",
    "- Increasing $K_i$ will help us to eliminate the steady-state error (i.e., the remaining error that we have when the system has converged).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can start by only adjusting $K_p$ while keeping $K_i=0$ and $K_d=0$ until the controller is somewhat able to reach the target. We can then fix $K_p$ at this value, and start adjusting $K_d$. Once we found the best $K_d$, we then proceed to adjust $K_i$ as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above approach to tune PID controller may work in practice, there is no guarantee that our controller will be stable (e.g., our robot may oscillate or even completely diverge from the reference point). There are actually many studies have been conducted on analysing and designing the PID controller that we should be aware of and appreciate such as pole placement and Ziegler-Nichols methods that can help us to tune our PID controller. We encourage you to take a look at the literatures if you are interested!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at an example, let's first modify our drive function to take linear and angular velocities as an input rather than left and right turning rates."

As $L$ gets larger, the controller will be more inclined to cut corners to reach the target. In contrast, if $L$ is too small, the controller can cause the vehicle to overshoot and oscilattes around the reference trajectory (we will see this concretely later in the example below).\n",
