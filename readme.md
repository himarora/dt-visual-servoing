Some info about the repo and directory structure (Still WIP)

* 1_develop and 3_submit will be merged
* the simulator repo will be changed to point to the image and removed from the repo when
  I acquire the proper permissions
* The random template is only for testing; will be removed
* The fifos connector is the image that bridge agent - simulation, similar to what the
  experiment manager and scenario maker do
* Solution.py will also be used for local development to bridge ROS -> Middleware
