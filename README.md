## Description

This is a simple template for an ROS agent that does Lane Following with the Duckietown stack.

[This code is documented here](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT18/AIDO/out/ros_baseline.html).

## Running Locally

To run locally:

1. `pip2 install --user -r requirements.txt`
2. `git clone https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown src/gym-duckietown/`
3. `pip2 install --user src/gym-duckietown`
4. `python2 local_experiment.py`

If you are looking to use the old Duckietown stack (as is the case, running it out of the box), you will need to follow these steps in addition:

2a. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/duckietown/Software)

2b. `cd Software/catkin_ws && catkin_make`

2c. `source devel/setup.bash`

And then, you can run step 4.
