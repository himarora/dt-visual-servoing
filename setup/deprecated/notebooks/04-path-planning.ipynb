    "Planning is a crucial part of the autonomous driving pipeline. The subfield of planning corresponds to higher-level reasoning, where as last week's topic - control - focuses more on the specifics of how to move accurately. Planners come in many forms, but here, we're concerned with _motion planning_, or the task of moving from point A to B while avoiding collision with known obstacles. For simplicity, we will focusing on planning in a two-dimensional workspace, although many of the algorithms we see here can easily be extended to higher-dimensional spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will complete the implementation of a popular robotic motion planning algorithm: Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees, or RRT for short. The successful completion of this algorithm will allow your simulated Duckiebot to go from your current position to a goal position in a road with obstacles. \n",
