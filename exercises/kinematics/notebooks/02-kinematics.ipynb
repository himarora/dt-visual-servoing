    "Kinematics model studies the motion of bodies without considering forces and inertia of the robot. Having kinematics model is useful because allows us to compute the pose of the robot after applying a sequence of actions (e.g., motor commands) from a given initial pose, which is known as *forward kinematics*. The inverse problem, which is to compute the sequence of actions that will move the robot to a target pose from a given initial pose is called *inverse kinematics*. We have seen and derived the kinematics model of the Duckiebot in class, now let's see how we can actually use this model to do both forward and inverse kinematics."
